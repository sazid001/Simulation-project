                <p>AB de Villiers (born 17 February 1984) is a South African cricketer,
                    who plays all formats and also a former captain in all formats.
                    He has been rated as the number one batsman in Tests and ODIs on several occasions. <br><br>
                    [1][2] Often regarded as one of the best batsmen of his generation and also regarded as one of the greatest of all time,[3] De Villi
                    ers holds many batting records, including the world's fastest ODI 50, 100 and 150, th
                    e fastest Test century by a South African and the fastest T20I 50 by a South African.
                    AB de Villiers is also among one of the marquee players in T20 Global League. <br><br>
                    He began his international career as a wicketkeeper-batsman (returning to the role for a few years in mid-career), but has played most often solely as a batsman. He has batted at various positions in the batting order but predominantly in the middle-order. Noted as one of the most innovative batsmen in the modern game, De Villiers is noted for many unorthodox shots behind the wicket-keeper and slips, which earned him the nickname Mr. 360. He made his international debut in a Test match against England in 2004 and first played an ODI in early 2005. His debut in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. As of 2016, he has passed
                    8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket and has a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game.

                <p>De Villiers was born in Warmbad,[5] and enjoyed what he later described as the "really relaxed lifestyle up there, where everyone knows everyone".[6] He went to high school in Pretoria along with fellow teammate Faf du Plessis. They attended the prestigious Afrikaanse HoÃ«r Seunskool. AB returned home for weekends. His father was a doctor who had played rugby union in his youth, and he encouraged his son to play sport; as a child, De Villiers played cricket at his home. His autobiography was published in September 2016. Beside cricket,
                    <br><br>De Villiers also excelled at golf, rugby and tennis in his youth.[6] He has been involved in charity works.[7]</p>

                        column-count: 3;margin-top: 50px;">De Villiers became the second youngest and second fastest South African to reach 1000 test runs after Graeme Pollock. In his Test career so far has batted, bowled and kept wicket. Even though he excelled in other sports, he chose to pursue a career in cricket and, after a spell in the South Africa U19 team, he made his debut for the Titans in 2003/4. He also played for Carrickfergus Cricket Club in Northern Ireland as their overseas player in 2004.

                    He made his Test debut as a 20-year-old on 16 December 2004 against England at Port Elizabeth. He made an impression opening the batting, but was dropped down the order for the second Test and also handed the wicket-keeping gloves. In this match, he made a match saving half century from number seven. However, he found himself at the top of the order again for the final Test of the series and has played the majority of his Test innings there.

                    Despite a good tour of the Caribbean where he scored 178 to help South Africa seal a Test series win, his rapid progress was halted on the tour of Australia in 2005. Despite playing Shane Warne well, he struggled and made just 152 runs in 6 innings.</p>

                <p>He has been used in a similar fashion to Jonty Rhodes in ODIs, opening the innings, although he currently bats in the middle order. De Villiers gave the selectors a sign by producing his then highest one-day score of 92 not out, which included 12 fours and one six, from 98 balls against India in the 2006 winter series.

                    De Villiers has a reputation as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of Simon Katich of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who was also one of the finest fielders of his generation.

                    In 2009, he was nominated for ICC Cricketer of the year and ICC Test Player of the year.

                    On 6 June 2011, then S.A. coach Gary Kirsten announced that AB de Villiers will be South Africa's new limited-overs captain. "I'm very excited but I'm also inexperienced.
                    <br><br>But I've learnt a lot the last seven years from an unbelievable captain," said De Villiers, who had never captained a team at first-class level. "It's a big responsibility, but there'll be a fresh look in the side, which is good."</p>

                <h3>Record breaking</h3>
                <p>On 18 January 2015, De Villiers scored the fastest century by a batsman in One Day International cricket, off 31 balls and eventually scoring 149 runs off 44 balls in 59 minutes[21] against West Indies.[22]</p>
                <h3>2015 World Cup</h3>
                <p style="-webkit-column-count:3;-moz-column-count:3 ;column-count:3 ;">De Villiers was one of the top performers at the 2015 Cricket World Cup scoring 482 runs at an average of 96.0 and strike rate of 144.0 during the tournament.[23]

                    On 27 February 2015, De Villiers scored 162 runs off 66 balls in a match against the West Indies in Pool B of 2015 Cricket World Cup; leading South Africa to their second highest total in world cup history (408) on the Sydney Cricket Ground. With this feat, he became the record holder for the fastest 50, 100, and 150 in One-Day International history.

                    Under the captaincy of De Villiers, South Africa qualified for the semi-finals of the World Cup but lost to New Zealand in the match. De Villiers finished the tournament as the third highest run-getter with 482 runs behind Martin Guptill and Kumar Sangakkara.

                    At the end of the tournament, he was ranked number 1 in the ICC batsmen rating in One day International cricket and number 3 in the ICC batsmen rating in Test cricket.[24]</p>

                <h3>Since 2016</h3>
                <p>On 6 January 2016, the second test match between England and South Africa ended in a draw. After the end of the match, Hashim Amla resigned from the captaincy and De Villiers was chosen to captain South Africa for the last two matches.

                    On 21 February 2016, de Villiers scored the fastest T20 fifty by a South African in just 21 balls. He completed the innings at 79 runs in 29 balls and led South Africa to a clean sweep in T20 series.

                    On 18 January 2017, De Villiers ruled himself out from most of the Test matches that South Africa is going to play in 2017.[25] De Villiers completed 9000 ODI runs in 205 innings and 9005 balls; this set a new record in terms of innings taken to reach 9000 runs.
                    <br><br> He won the Man of the Series award in the series versus New Zealand.</p>
